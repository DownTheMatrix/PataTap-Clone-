# PataTap-Clone 

A simple patatap clone project using paper.js and howler.js.

## Known Issues

Due to cross-origins issues, it's not possible to preview the project on Chrome. It's advisable to test it using FireFox, or run it into a local server. In order to do that, there are a couple of simple methods:

+ Launch a local server with Python (open the console and type):

  `python -m http.server` (for Python 3x);
  `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (for Python 2x);

Then proceed to the default address `http://localhost:8000`.

+ Launch a local server with Node (open the node.js console and type):

  `http-server`

As above, the default address is `http://localhost:8000`.

### Todo

Add extra effects and animations.
